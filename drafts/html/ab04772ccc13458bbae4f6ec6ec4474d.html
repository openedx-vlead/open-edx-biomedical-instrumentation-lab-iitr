<p>1) To study the wave shapes of ECG signals under incorrect electrode placements recorded by Lead I, Lead II (reference lead RL) and Chest lead (V1) ECG system.<br /> 2)To study the wave shapes of ECG signal under incorrect electrode for 120 different abnormalities for example-premature contraction, arrhythmias, ventricle focus, different BPM, fibrillations, different rhythms , with noise, cardiac abnormalities etc.<br /> 3) To review output graph for different gains for following signals &ndash; Lead I Lead II Lead III , aVL aVR aVF, Lead V1<br /> 4) To assess your knowledge about the experiment by answering a questionnaire at the end of the experiment.</p>
