<p><em>Experimental </em><em>Objective</em>- - Record the EEG. At the same time, approximate entropy of 5 epochs of width &ldquo;0.2 sec&rdquo; each are calculated.</p>
<p><em>Calculation </em><em>method-</em>Approximate entropy is a ``regularity statistic'' that quantifies the unpredictability of fluctuations in a time series such as an instantaneous heart rate time series.</p>
<p><em>Scientific </em><em>principle-</em>Brain activity is related to ions and charge movement, this activity can be detected by electrodes. The record of the brain's activity is called an electroencephalogram (EEG) from the root words of electro (electrical), encephalo (brain), and gram (record).<br /> The EEG records the electrical activity on the surface of the cerebral cortex. The EEG is complex and variable between adults, although&nbsp; under certain conditions, the EEG exhibits&nbsp; simpler, rhythmic activity. Simpler patterns in the EEG occur when many cells synchronize their input to the surface of the cerebral cortex. The more synchronized the charge movement, the more rhythmic the EEG.<br /> EEG changes as a person grows. The development of EEG is rapid with new-borns. As neural development proceeds, the EEG recorded from the posterior regions of the brain of an infant of 3-4 months begins to resemble EEGs recorded from the posterior region of adults. The difference is that the 3-4 month old infants have EEGs in the frequency range of 3-4 Hz, whereas adults tend to have average frequencies of 10 Hz. By the time the infant is one year old, the posterior region EEG is approximately 6 Hz, by three years, 8 Hz, and by 13-14 years (puberty), the average frequency is 10 Hz (similar to adults).<br /> Approximate entropy is a statistical measure that attempts to quantify the predictability of a data sequence. A perfectly predictable data series (such as a pure sine wave) has an approximate entropy of zero. Several studies are beginning to examine approximate entropy of EEG data and its relationship to external factors, such as drugs and sleep states.<br /> A low approximate entropy value (meaning that the EEG recording is regular and predictable) indicates the anaesthetized state of the subject. A high approximate entropy value (meaning that the EEG recording is irregular and unpredictable) indicates that the subject is conscious. Approximate entropy is defined as the unpredictability of subsequent samples in a time series based on the knowledge of previous samples.<br /> Advantages of approximate entropy-</p>
<ol>
<li>Lower computational demand. Approximate entropy can be designed to work for small data samples (n &lt; 50 points) and can be applied in real time.</li>
<li>Less effect from noise. If data are noisy, the approximate entropy measure can be compared to the noise level in the data to determine what quality of true information may be present in the data.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Application</em><em>- </em>It has been applied to classify EEG in psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, and addiction.</p>
