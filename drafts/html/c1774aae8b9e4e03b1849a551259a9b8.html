<p><em>Experimental Objective</em>- Record the EMG. At the same time, perform one of the following operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>EMG Acquisition and Alpha RMS signal</li>
<li>EMG Acquisition and Average Rectified EMG signal</li>
<li>EMG Acquisition and Frequency Analysis</li>
<li>EMG Acquisition and Power Analysis</li>
<li>EMG Acquisition and Integrated EMG Analysis</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Calculation method-</em> Algorithms used are different for all the 5 operations present in the toolbox, these are the default algorithms of AcqKnowledge software (BIOPAC).</p>
<p><em>Scientific principle-</em> EMG signals have a variety of clinical and biomedical applications. EMG is used as a diagnostics tool for identifying neuromuscular diseases, or as a research tool for studying kinesiology, and disorders of motor control. EMG signals are sometimes used to guide botulinum toxin or phenol injections into muscles. EMG signals are also used as a control signal for prosthetic devices such as prosthetic hands, arms, and lower limbs. EMG then acceleromyograph may be used for neuromuscular monitoring in general anesthesia with neuromuscular-blocking drugs, in order to avoid postoperative residual curarization (PORC).<br /> Rectification is the translation of the raw EMG signal to a single polarity frequency (usually positive). The purpose of rectifying a signal is to ensure the raw signal does not average zero, due to the raw EMG signal having positive and negative components. It facilitates the signals and process and calculates the mean, integration and the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The two types of rectification of signals refer to what happens to the EMG wave when it is processed. These types include full length frequency and half length. Full length frequency adds the EMG signal below the baseline (usually negative polarity) to the signal above the baseline making a conditioned signal that is all positive. This is the preferred method of rectification because it conserves all signal energy for analysis, usually in the positive polarity. Half-length rectification deletes the EMG signal below the baseline. In doing so, the average of the data is no longer zero therefore it can be used in statistical analyses. The only difference between the two types of rectification is that full-wave rectification takes the absolute value of the signal array of data points.</p>
