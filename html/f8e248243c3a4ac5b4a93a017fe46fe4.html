<p>1) To study the wave shapes of ECG signals by Lead II system.<br /> 2)To study the wave shapes of ECG signal for 120 different abnormalities for example-premature contraction, arrhythmias, ventricle focus, different BPM, fibrillations, different rhythms , with noise, cardiac abnormalities etc.<br /> 3) To review output graph for R-R tachogram, PSD of interpolated R-R interval, Poincare plot, R-R Histogram, Non- Parameteric Spectrum.<br /> 4) To assess your knowledge about the experiment by answering a questionnaire at the end of the experiment.</p>
